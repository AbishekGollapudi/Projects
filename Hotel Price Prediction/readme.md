# How to Identify Hotel Deals in Las Vegas

----------
* In today's day and age, almost everything we purchase were either online or in stores have went on some sort of 
sales or were discounted .As a cunsumer myself, it has become the norm to buy only buy things when they are on sale. 
When this kind of phenomenon is occuring all around us, how can we correctly identify if the product we are purchasing 
is actually having a deal? In this project, we will explore and investigate this question using a 
hotel price prediction in Las Vegas during the holiday season of 2019 as our case study.
