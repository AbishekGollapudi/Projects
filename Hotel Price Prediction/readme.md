# How to Identify Hotel Deals in Las Vegas

----------
In today's day and age, almost everything we purchase online or in stores have to be either discounted or on a sale. As a consumer myself, it became the norm to buy only buy things when they are on sale. When this type of purchasing pattern is happening all around us, how can we distinguish if the sales or discounts we are receiving are actual discounts/sales? Hotels, for example, is one of the most common purchases we make which seems like are always discounted. In this study, I want to explore the theory of predicting hotel prices in Las Vegas using Machine Learning and ultimately use the prediction to determine if you are being offered a deal. Let's get to it!

#### Approaches
1. Scrap hotel listing information from Hotel.com
2. Preprocess the data
3. Train a machine learning model
4. Evaluate the model performance
5. Takeaways and recommendations
