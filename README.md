## AirBnb New User Booking Prediction
Utilized supervised machine learning models such as Logistic, KNN, Bayesian, RandomForest, XGBoost, and CatBoost to determine if a new user would make a reservation within 5 days after visiting the site. Insights on user behavior led to making strategic recommendations for a marketing campaign. Developed and deployed a web app using Flask and hosted it with Heroku.
